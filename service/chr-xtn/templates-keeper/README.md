# Templates Keeper

Chrome extension which works as PhraseExpress in the browser


You can attach your common used texts to prefered keybinding. 

Example: associate the key combination of 'alt+z' with your email and your phone number with 'alt+x', thus making filling out registration forms much more convenient.
Now instead if typing your mail, you can just press 'alt+z'

Note that the extension writes in your clipboard so keep that in mind.

# Motivation

I am Chromebook and Ubuntu user, but before I was on Windows.
One thing I missed the most from Windows was **PhraseExpress**, so I builded this browser version of its functionality.
I am considering doing the same with Electron, so I can use it on Ubuntu as well. 
Also I need to type German but I am not used to its configuration and I don't like changing to German input method when I have a walkaround. I bind German special alphabet characters with **Templates Keeper** and my tiny problem is solved

# What is included

Only one keybinding is turned on by default: alt+q and  a demo text
