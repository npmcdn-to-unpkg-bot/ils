While I somehow agree with it, I think that the main reason is the lack of proper tooling.</p><p>Private lessons, educational courses, online courses, language partner exchange, all those practices are considered useful. I won&#x27;t debate over their usefulness, but I claim that all off them are very slow, compared to what actually can be build today</p><h2>Applications</h2><ol><li><a href="/learningMeme">Learning Meme</a> - Meme with hidden German word, its translation and example sentence is displayed. The aim is to write the hidden word.</li><li><a href="/writeSentence">Write German Sentence</a> - You will see an English sentence and you have to write its German translation.

As a clue, the user can see the beginning of each word.</li><li><a href="/writeSentenceLite">Write German Sentence Lite</a> - You will see an English sentence and you have to write its translation.
